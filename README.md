# t-time
GTFS to HTML processor

This Python script will take files from a [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) feed and output a static SPA that contains a schedule for the routes selected.

1. download a feed
2. unzip it somewhere
3. run t-time.py in somewhere
4. copy the output HTML file where ever you'd like
 - it is self contained: all JS and CSS is contained within

This will developed against the [Port Authority of Allegheny County's GTFS feed](http://www.portauthority.org/GeneralTransitFeed/). PAAC.html is it's output.
